Libre is a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain designed for scalable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Built with a focus on low fees, fast transactions, and regulatory compliance, Libre provides a secure and developer-friendly environment for creating financial products that bridge traditional and blockchain-based markets.
Its architecture supports interoperability with Ethereum and other EVM networks, making it an attractive choice for institutions and innovators in Web3.

## Key Features of Libre
* **EVM Compatibility**: Fully supports Ethereum tools, smart contracts, and development frameworks.
* **High Performance**: Optimized for fast block times and high transaction throughput.
* **Low Fees**: Cost-effective transactions suitable for retail and institutional use.
* **RWA Tokenization**: Enables issuance and lifecycle management of real-world assets on-chain.
* **Regulatory Alignment**: Supports KYC/AML compliance for financial applications.
* **Interoperability**: Bridges to Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains.

## Libreâ€™s Role in the Blockchain Ecosystem
Libre combines DeFi innovation with traditional finance standards. By enabling regulated asset tokenization alongside DeFi tools, it provides a bridge between banks, fintech companies, and blockchain-native protocols, contributing to wider adoption of Web3 in financial services.

## Libre Wallets
Libre-compatible wallets allow users to interact with the network, manage assets, and execute smart contracts.

### Types of Libre Wallets
* **Software Wallets**: Browser extensions like MetaMask configured with Libreâ€™s RPC.
* **Hardware Wallets**: Devices like Ledger and Trezor for offline key storage.
* **Web Wallets**: Platform-provided interfaces for quick access.
* **Mobile Wallets**: Apps supporting custom EVM networks for on-the-go access.

## Popular Libre Wallet: MetaMask
MetaMask can be connected to Libre by manually adding its network configuration. This allows users to send/receive tokens and interact with Libre-based applications.

## Understanding Libre Gas Fees
Libre uses gas fees to compensate validators for securing the network and executing smart contracts. Its low-fee model supports both high-frequency trading and institutional asset management.

###Factors Affecting Gas Fees
* **Network Usage**: High demand can cause temporary fee increases.

* **Transaction Complexity**: Complex smart contracts require more computation and thus more gas.

* **Fee Settings**: Users can adjust gas prices for faster confirmations.

## Libre Testnet
Libre offers a testnet environment for developers to experiment before deploying to mainnet. It mirrors mainnet functionality and supports the same EVM tools.

##Features of Libre Testnet
* **Full EVM Support**: Works with Solidity, Hardhat, Remix, and Foundry.

* **Safe RWA Simulation**: Developers can test asset tokenization workflows.

* **Faucet Access**: Free test tokens are available for development.

* **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates to match production behavior.

## Accessing Libre Testnet
Developers can configure wallets like MetaMask with Libre testnet RPC and chain ID, available in official documentation, and request test tokens from the faucet.

## Conclusion
Libre is a versatile, regulation-ready blockchain designed for high-performance DeFi and RWA tokenization. With low fees, strong EVM compatibility, and a robust testnet, it offers a secure and scalable foundation for next-generation financial applications.
