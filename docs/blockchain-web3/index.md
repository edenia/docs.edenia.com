# Blockchain and Web3


Web3 represents the next evolution of the World Wide Web, offering a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain technology. Unlike its predecessors, Web3 emphasizes user privacy, data ownership, and decentralized applications (DApps) that operate on blockchain networks like [Ethereum](/docs/blockchain-web3/blockchain-web3-ethereum), [Polygon](/docs/blockchain-web3/blockchain-web3-polygon), and [Base](/docs/blockchain-web3/blockchain-web3-base). This paradigm shift towards decentralization enables more secure, transparent, and user-centric online experiences.

## Key Features of Web3

- **Decentralization:** Eliminating central points of control or failure, enhancing security and resistance to censorship.
- **Blockchain Technology:** Utilizing blockchain for transparency, security, and immutability of data. Learn about [consensus mechanisms](/docs/blockchain-consensus-mechanism) and [blockchain security](/docs/blockchain-web3/eos-learn/blockchain-security).
- **Tokenization:** Digital assets and cryptocurrencies represent real-world assets and value. Explore [Real World Assets (RWA)](/docs/blockchain-web3/blockchain-web3-rwa.io).
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated, self-executing contracts that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. See our [EOSIO smart contract guides](/docs/blockchain-web3/eos-learn/smart-contract).

## Web3 and Real World Assets (RWA)

The advent of Web3 and tokenization of real-world assets represents a significant shift in how we interact with the digital and financial worlds. Platforms like Defactor are at the forefront of this transformation, offering innovative solutions that integrate the reliability of traditional asset classes with the efficiency and flexibility of DeFi. This synergy is set to redefine finance, making it more accessible, transparent, and efficient.
