# Claude Code (Anthropic)

> **What is it?**  
Claude Code is a **terminal**-based, AI-assisted development tool created by **Anthropic in 2024**.  
It integrates with the CLI workflow: explores repositories, runs tests, fixes errors, and creates PRs in **natural language**.  
Unlike traditional copilots, it **understands entire projects** (millions of tokens) and can act as a more **autonomous agent**.

:::tip Quick summary
- Fast onboarding on large codebases  
- Automates repetitive Git/CI tasks  
- Handy commands like `/security-review` to detect vulnerabilities  
:::

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**  
- **Terminal access** (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

## Installation & activation

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```  



## Then inside your project:
``` 
claude
``` 


Relevant usage

- Rapid onboarding in large codebases (broad context awareness).

- Automates Git/CI/CD chores and routine shell tasks.

- Security: includes the /security-review command to scan for vulnerabilities.

- Documentation: generate function explanations or dependency diagrams.

:::note Real-world report
A former Google engineering VP reported finishing a ~3-week project in 2 days using Claude Code, but hit issues like context loss and an accidental file cleanup that deleted important work—so keep backups and review diffs. (Business Insider)

### Use cases

- Debugging: run tests, identify errors, suggest/implement fixes.

- Refactoring: modernize entire projects with guided commands.

- Security: automatic analysis of dependencies and insecure code.

Documentation: generate technical summaries and dependency maps.

Recommended scenarios

- Ideal if you live in the terminal.
- Great for backend teams and large projects.
- If you want a fully visual IDE experience, consider Cursor or Windsurf instead.
- It can lose context or make undesired changes → always validate before committing.

:::caution Good practices

Work on a separate branch.

Review diffs/PRs before merging.

Keep CI and branch protections in place.

Conclusion

Claude Code represents a shift from passive copilot to an active agent embedded in the developer workflow.
Its strength is saving weeks on repetitive tasks, accelerating everything from onboarding to production—provided you keep human review and safeguards in the loop.
