# Claude Code (Anthropic)

**Claude Code** is **Anthropic**'s agentic coding tool that "lives" in the terminal, integrating the full development workflow: reading issues, generating changes, running tests, and opening pull requests (PRs) on GitHub/GitLab, all from the CLI. It evolved from an internal research project to give Anthropic engineers a native way to integrate Claude into their daily work and was publicly released in 2024â€“2025.

**Platform Availability:** macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL)  
**Launch Date:** 2024  
**Enterprise Release:** August 2025  
**Official Website:** [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)  
**Documentation:** [docs.anthropic.com/claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)

## Overview

Claude Code represents a paradigm shift toward terminal-native AI development. Unlike IDE-based AI assistants, Claude Code operates entirely through command-line interfaces, embracing Unix philosophy with composable, pipeable tools that integrate seamlessly into existing developer workflows.

### Key Differentiators

- **Terminal-Native**: Designed for CLI-first development workflows
- **Unix Composability**: Can be chained with pipes and system tools
- **Minimalist Architecture**: Simple bash and file editing tools
- **Enterprise Ready**: Full administrative controls and compliance features

---

## Core Features

### CLI-First Development
- **Composable Commands**: Unix-style tool chaining with pipes
- **Session Management**: Persistent context across terminal sessions
- **File Operations**: Direct editing through string replacement
- **Command Execution**: Intelligent bash command generation and execution

### Git Integration
- **Issue Reading**: Automatic parsing of GitHub/GitLab issues
- **Branch Management**: Intelligent branch creation and switching
- **PR Creation**: Automated pull request generation with descriptions
- **CI/CD Integration**: Test execution and deployment automation

### Agentic Workflows
- **Multi-Step Tasks**: Complex operations completed autonomously
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains understanding across file operations
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry and error correction

### Enterprise Security
- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR)**: Optional data retention policies
- **SOC 2 Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security standards
- **RBAC Controls**: Role-based access management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

---

## Technical Architecture

### Minimalist Tool Design
Claude Code uses only two core tools:
1. **Bash Tool**: Execute shell commands and system operations
2. **File Edit Tool**: Apply string-based replacements to files

This minimalist approach reduces complexity while maintaining powerful capabilities through intelligent tool combination.

## Use Cases & Applications

### End-to-End Development Workflows
**Scenario**: Convert GitHub issue to deployed feature  
**Implementation**:
```bash
$ claude -p "Read issue #123, create a branch, implement the solution with TDD, run npm test, and open a PR with summary and checklist."
```

### Automated Security Reviews
**Scenario**: Continuous security assessment  
**Implementation**: GitHub Action triggered on each PR, applying security rules and commenting inline with mitigation recommendations.

### Observability and Monitoring
**Scenario**: Intelligent log analysis and incident response  
**Implementation**:
```bash
$ tail -f app.log | claude -p "if 5xx errors persist > 2 min, open an issue with attachments and config diff"
```

### Codebase Onboarding
**Scenario**: Understanding large, complex repositories  
**Implementation**: CLAUDE.md files guide the agent through repo structure, conventions, objectives, and quality criteria.
