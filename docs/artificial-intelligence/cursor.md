---

## Rules System

Cursor's Rules system allows you to customize how the AI behaves and maintains context across your projects. Rules help ensure consistency, enforce coding standards, and provide project-specific guidance to the AI assistant.

### Types of Rules

#### 1. Project Rules (`.cursorrules` file)
Project-specific rules that apply only to the current workspace:

**Location**: Root of your project directory  
**File**: `.cursorrules`  
**Scope**: Current project only

**Example Project Rules:**
```
# Project Rules for React TypeScript App
- Always use TypeScript, never JavaScript
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure in /src/components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow the established API patterns in /src/api
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Prefer composition over inheritance
```

#### 2. Global Rules
User-wide rules that apply to all projects:

**Location**: Cursor settings  
**Scope**: All projects  
**Access**: Settings → Rules

**Example Global Rules:**
```
# Global Development Rules
- Always write clean, readable code
- Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Use version control best practices
```

#### 3. Workspace Rules
Rules specific to a particular workspace or team:

**Location**: Workspace settings  
**Scope**: Current workspace  
**Access**: Workspace settings

### Rule Categories

#### **Code Style Rules**
- **Formatting**: Indentation, spacing, line length
- **Naming Conventions**: Variables, functions, classes
- **File Organization**: Directory structure, imports
- **Language Preferences**: TypeScript vs JavaScript, Python version

#### **Architecture Rules**
- **Design Patterns**: MVC, MVVM, Repository pattern
- **Framework Guidelines**: React patterns, Next.js conventions
- **Database Rules**: ORM usage, query patterns
- **API Design**: RESTful conventions, response formats

#### **Quality Rules**
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Exception management, logging
- **Security Guidelines**: Input validation, authentication
- **Performance**: Optimization patterns, caching strategies

#### **Project-Specific Rules**
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific requirements
- **Integration Patterns**: Third-party service usage
- **Deployment Rules**: Environment configurations
- **Documentation Standards**: Code comments, README requirements

### How Rules Work

#### **Rule Processing**
1. **Priority Order**: Project rules override global rules
2. **Context Awareness**: Rules are applied based on file type and location
3. **Dynamic Application**: Rules are considered for every AI interaction
4. **Consistency Enforcement**: AI suggestions align with established rules

#### **Rule Syntax**
```
# Comments start with #
- Use bullet points for rules
- Be specific and actionable
- Include examples when helpful
- Group related rules together

# Example rule groups:
## Code Style
- Use camelCase for variables
- Use PascalCase for components

## Architecture
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use the existing API service layer
```

### Best Practices for Rules

#### **Writing Effective Rules**
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "write good code", specify "use meaningful variable names"
- **Provide Context**: Explain why a rule exists
- **Include Examples**: Show what good and bad implementations look like
- **Keep Updated**: Review and update rules as projects evolve

#### **Rule Organization**
- **Group by Category**: Separate style, architecture, and quality rules
- **Use Clear Headers**: Make sections easy to navigate
- **Version Control**: Track rule changes in your repository
- **Team Review**: Collaborate on rule definitions

### Advanced Rule Features

#### **Conditional Rules**
```
# Apply different rules based on file type
- For TypeScript files: Use strict typing
- For test files: Use descriptive test names
- For configuration files: Use YAML format
```

#### **Context-Aware Rules**
```
# Rules that depend on project structure
- If using React: Use functional components
- If using Next.js: Follow App Router conventions
- If using Express: Use middleware pattern
```

#### **Team Collaboration**
- **Shared Rules**: Store rules in version control
- **Rule Reviews**: Regular team discussions about coding standards
- **Onboarding**: New team members inherit established rules
- **Evolution**: Rules adapt as team practices mature

### Memory System Integration

Rules work in conjunction with Cursor's Memory system:

- **Persistent Context**: Rules help maintain consistent behavior across sessions
- **Learning Integration**: AI learns from rule compliance patterns
- **Adaptive Suggestions**: Suggestions improve based on rule adherence
- **Project Continuity**: Rules ensure consistent code quality over time

### Getting Started with Rules

1. Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root
2. Start with basic coding standards
3. Add project-specific guidelines
4. Test with simple AI interactions

#### **Step 2: Configure Global Rules**
1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to Rules section
3. Add universal preferences
4. Set default behaviors

#### **Step 3: Iterate and Improve**
1. Monitor AI suggestions for rule compliance
2. Refine rules based on team feedback
3. Add new rules as patterns emerge
4. Remove outdated or conflicting rules
