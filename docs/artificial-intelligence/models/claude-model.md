## What is Claude?

**Claude** is Anthropic’s family of large language models (LLMs), launched in **2023** and evolved through Claude 2, 3.x, and 4.x. It is built on the **Constitutional AI** safety framework and is known for strong coding, careful reasoning, and enterprise-aligned behavior. Latest flagship variants include **Claude Opus 4.1** with top coding performance.

---

## Creator & Release Year

- **Creator**: Anthropic  
- **Initial Public Availability**: 2023  
- **Ecosystem**: Claude app, Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Claude Code

---

## Core Capabilities (for developers)

- **Deep, careful reasoning** with strong step-by-step analysis.  
- **Excellent coding support**: multi-file refactoring, debugging, tests, and explanations.  
- **Multimodal (text+image)** support and tool-use integrations.  
- **Large context windows** (variant-dependent, high hundreds of thousands of tokens in newer models).  
- **Constitutional AI safeguards**: safer completions and the ability to say “I don’t know.”

---

## Pros

- **Best-in-class coding and refactoring** (notably in Opus 4.1).  
- **High alignment and safety posture** suitable for regulated environments.  
- **Thoughtful, consistent outputs** with fewer unsafe hallucinations.

---

## Cons

- **Closed-source** with pricing/quotas that may be higher than open models.  
- **Longer latency** in deeper reasoning modes.  
- **Feature rollouts** can be region- or platform-limited initially.

---

## Key Differentiators

- **Constitutional AI** provides consistent, aligned behavior and self-critique.  
- **Artifacts/Code workflows** elevate developer UX beyond chat.  
- **Coding leadership** on real-world tasks and multi-file edits.

## Comparisons and When to Choose Claude

- **Claude vs GPT-5**: Claude Opus 4.1 is extremely strong for multi-file coding and rigorous reasoning; GPT-5 offers broader Microsoft ecosystem and hybrid routing. Choose Claude when coding depth, agentic workflows, and safer reasoning are paramount.  
- **Claude vs DeepSeek**: DeepSeek is cost-efficient and open; Claude provides higher alignment guarantees and polished DX.  
- **Claude vs Grok**: Grok 4 emphasizes real-time X/Tesla ecosystems; Claude is more conservative and enterprise-friendly for software teams.  
- **Claude vs Gemini**: Gemini leads in native multimodality and Google integrations; Claude often wins for structured analysis and code.

## Benchmarks, Context Window, and Pricing

- **Benchmarks**: Claude Opus 4.1 reports leading coding results (e.g., SWE-bench Verified).  
- **Context window**: Very large (variant-dependent; suitable for long repos and documents).  
- **Pricing**: Tiered by model and provider (Anthropic API, Bedrock, Vertex). See official pricing pages for current rates.

## Variants and Recommended Use

| Variant | Best suited for |
|---|---|
| Haiku / 3.5 Haiku | Prototyping, fast/low-cost tasks |
| Sonnet / 4.x Sonnet | Balanced business workflows |
| Opus / 4.1 Opus | Complex engineering, multi-step/code-heavy tasks |

---

## Prompting Tips

- Be explicit about inputs/outputs and audience.  
- Use multi-shot examples for format consistency.  
- Request citations or “I don’t know” in sensitive domains.
