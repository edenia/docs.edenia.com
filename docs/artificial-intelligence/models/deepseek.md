## Creator & Release Year

- **Creator**: DeepSeek Inc.  
- **Initial Public Availability**: 2023 (company), 2024–2025 (models)  
- **Ecosystem**: Open-source releases, Hugging Face, integrations in consumer apps and assistants

---

## Core Capabilities (for developers)

- **Advanced reasoning** (R1) with reinforcement learning for problem-solving.  
- **Mixture-of-experts (V3/V3.1)** with MLA for efficient, stable training.  
- **Coder specialization** (Coder-V2) across 338 languages; strong code generation/explanations.  
- **Long context** up to ~128K tokens (variant-dependent).  
- **Tool use** and hybrid “thinking/fast” modes (V3.1).

---

## Pros

- **Outstanding price/performance** and accessibility.  
- **Open and transparent** licensing (MIT in many releases).  
- **Competitive coding and reasoning** vs top closed models.

---

## Cons

- **Governance concerns**: censorship and data residency in mainland China.  
- **Enterprise support** may be lighter than closed, managed offerings.  
- **Safety/bias** risks in multilingual or adversarial contexts.

---

## Key Differentiators

- **Open(ish) releases** and community availability on Hugging Face.  
- **Hybrid architecture** enabling both deep reasoning and fast inference.  
- **Coder variants** highly competitive on programming tasks.

---

## Comparisons and When to Choose DeepSeek

- **DeepSeek vs GPT-5**: Choose DeepSeek for cost-sensitive, open deployments and local control; GPT-5 for enterprise compliance, safety features, and Microsoft ecosystem.  
- **DeepSeek vs Claude**: DeepSeek emphasizes price/perf and openness; Claude emphasizes alignment, cautious reasoning, and polished developer UX.  
- **DeepSeek vs Grok**: Grok focuses on real-time X/Tesla integrations; DeepSeek is better for open research, coding assistants, and self-hosted options.  
- **DeepSeek vs Gemini**: Gemini for Google-native multimodality; DeepSeek for open alternatives with strong coding.

---

## Architecture & Version Evolution

- **DeepSeek R1** (2025): reasoning-centered, RL-trained.  
- **DeepSeek V3** (2024): MoE (671B total, 37B active), MLA.  
- **DeepSeek V3.1**: Hybrid thinking/fast; tools; 128K context.  
- **DeepSeek-Coder-V2**: Coding model; 338 languages; 128K context; strong coding/math benchmarks.

---

## Benchmarks, Context Window, and Pricing

- **Benchmarks**: Public reports show strong coding/math; some variants outperform earlier GPT-4-Turbo.  
- **Context window**: up to ~128K tokens (variant-dependent).  
- **Pricing**: Very competitive for hosted APIs; open-source checkpoints enable self-hosting to reduce costs further.

---

## Variants and Recommended Use

| Variant | Best suited for |
|---|---|
| R1 | High-reasoning tasks (math, planning, diagnostics) |
| V3/V3.1 | Efficient, long-context, tool-using applications |
| Coder-V2 | Programming assistants, multi-language repos |

---

## Practical Tips

- Start with open-source checkpoints; evaluate hosted APIs for latency/scale.  
- Add governance: content filters, privacy controls, bias audits.  
- For coding, prefer Coder-V2; for planning/analysis, evaluate R1 or V3.1.
