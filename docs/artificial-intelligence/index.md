# Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** section. This area contains resources, guides, and documentation related to AI technologies, their implementation, and their broader impact on society.  

AI is one of the most transformative fields of our time, shaping industries from healthcare to finance, education, security, and creative work. This documentation aims to provide both foundational knowledge and practical guidelines to understand, build, and responsibly deploy AI systems.

# Context and Evolution

Artificial Intelligence has its roots in the 1950s, when early pioneers like Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky began exploring whether machines could simulate aspects of human intelligence. Early AI focused on **symbolic logic and expert systems**.  

From the 1980s onward, AI shifted toward **machine learning**—statistical methods that learn from data. The breakthroughs of the 2010s, particularly **deep learning** and the availability of large-scale data and GPUs, ushered in the era of modern AI: computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning powering real-world applications.  

Since 2020, the emergence of **foundation models** (like GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.) has defined the "agentic" era: large models capable of reasoning, planning, coding, and interacting autonomously across platforms.

- Start small: Proof of concept projects in low-risk areas.  
- Choose the right models: balance between accuracy, cost, and interpretability.  
- Build monitoring: track drift, performance, and bias in deployed systems.  

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

- Apply Zero Data Retention policies where possible.  
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit.  
- Establish clear retention and redaction policies.  
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO).  

##  Change Management

- Train teams in **prompt engineering** and **responsible AI use**.  
- Pilot AI with clear KPIs (efficiency gains, defect reduction, cost savings).  
- Expand adoption gradually once ROI is proven.  

##  Best Practices for Prompting

- Use structured prompts with examples.  
- Provide context (e.g., repo docs, domain-specific data).  
- Define limits: scope, acceptance criteria, guardrails.  
- Iterate and refine prompts for better results.
